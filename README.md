# THE WHY

Just making this page so for my own referral and for others to see if they want to check out my projects. There isn't enough spaces for the pinned repos!

A lot of the time github projects wont be finished or they wont have a readme so this is a good why to filter them out and show the ones which are completed. I say completed, but in reality I never feel satisfied with my projects and occasionally will go back to them, so they never really feel finished to me.
