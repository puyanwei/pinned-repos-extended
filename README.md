# THE WHY

Just making this page so for my own referral and for others to see if they want to check out my projects. There isn't enough spaces in the pinned repos!

A lot of the time github projects wont be finished or they wont have a readme so this is a good way to filter those ones out until they're ready. Its rare that I feel 100% satisfied with my projects I always think there are things that can be improved on.

Examples of this could be refactoring the structure of the code, naming conventions, quality of tests its coverage, [SOLID](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)>) principles, or a good readme.
